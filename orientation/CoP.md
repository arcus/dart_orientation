## Communities of Practice
A Community of Practice is a group of people who "share...a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly" [1]

In building your own Community of Practice, we hope that you will come together to find ways to connect that work best for you, enhancing your sense of connection with one another as well as your skill development.

### Practice

Regular practice is how people get better at things!

Doing something regularly can look different for different people:

- Synchronous (do this at a set time) or asynchronous (have done this by a set time)
- Accountability: how do we know that it is done?
- In person or virtual practice?
- With others in a community?


### Community

Starting a supportive community involves:

- Introducing yourself and getting to know others
- Answering others kindly and helpfully
- Being willing to say when you don’t understand something
- Regular communication
    - How do you start a conversation?
    - Where do you have the conversation?

### Starting a conversation

Types of communication that build progress can include:

- Problem solving: “I’m stuck, can we work on this together?”

- Requests for information: “How do we log in to this platform?”

- Seeking experience: “Has anyone seen this error message?”

- Sharing assets: “I took some notes that you can use to get started.”

- Coordination: “Let’s create a shared document for these notes.”

### Structures to build community

- Slack workspace (join via the email you received)

- Email: you will be getting an email with all of your cohort’s addresses

- Regular support check-ins from the DART team

- Cohort nicknames:

### Ways to build your Community of Practice

- Active Slack or Email conversations
- Journal club
- Scheduled time to work in parallel on modules
- Scheduled check-ins to talk about progress
- Social gatherings to get to know each other and celebrate accomplishments
- Anything else you want!


Importantly, the reason we're leaving this to you is that we want this to be fully customized to your own needs! 

## In your breakout rooms

- Introduce yourselves
- Discuss how you want to build your community of practice
- Elect a point person to
  - share your cohort’s initial ideas
  - respond to the email you get later today, sharing those ideas with people who could not attend
