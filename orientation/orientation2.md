# Welcome to DART

**Our goal**: To empower researchers to learn and use emerging data science methods.

There has been an explosion in the generation of healthcare and biomedical data in recent years (Agrawal & Prabakaran, 2020), including image data (radiology, neuroimaging, etc.), text data (patient records), complex time series and longitudinal data (continuous monitoring), and more. Growth in sequencing data alone is expected to eclipse other major generators of big data in the next few years, including astronomical data, Twitter, and YouTube (Stephens et al., 2015). This presents tremendous opportunities, but also tremendous challenges.

Traditional education can't keep up with the rapid developments in tools and techniques. Researchers need the support to engage in on-going education throughout their careers.

## Our research interests

Although there is an obvious need for biomedical data science training, there is a dearth of evidence on best practices to support learners outside of a traditional data science classroom.
With this project, we aim to contribute on several fronts:

- instrumentation and methodology for identifying meaningful **learner personas** in a population of biomedical researchers
- instrumentation for assessment of proximal and distal **outcomes** in practical data science education
- measuring **effectiveness** of the program, including the opportunity to examine effects individually within learner clusters and interactions between clusters and content
- developing best practice recommendations for **accessible and inclusive** online technical teaching materials



## Clustering Analysis

## Content creation

We're building content that directly addresses the goals in the [NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science](https://datascience.nih.gov/nih-strategic-plan-data-science).

### Modules

This program is composed of **modules**:

- short (1 hour or less), practical, and focused on clearly defined learning objectives
- free-standing, with no technical or data dependencies
- inclusive and accessible
- publicly documented and freely available
