## Data collection so far

Thank you so much for taking the time to fill out out surveys!

This project is both operational and scientific for us --- we're building a new educational program, and we're planning to gather data on its effectiveness to share with the learning science community.

You are part of our **pilot program**. This is not yet an active research project (we'll be starting that next year), but your responses are invaluable in helping us hone our instrumentation and methods!

### Survey 1: Clustering learners

In November, we sent out a survey with questions about a number of data science tasks asking you to rate yourself on:

- current level of **expertise** in that task
- desire to **learn** that task
- **relevance** of that task to your current work

There were 16 topics, for a total of 48 responses.  

#### Learner Personas: What and Why

--{{0}}--
****
For this project, we're using personas, which is an idea we're borrowing from design theories.

In design, it's typical to create "personas" for whatever product you're building, as a way to ensure you're thinking about more than just a single typical user when you're deciding what to build and how. A typical designer might create several user personas, each with a detailed description of what that imaginary person is like, their needs, constraints, etc.

Usually designers just make up personas. In some cases, though, like ours, personas are empirically defined based on data gathered from a population of real users.

**What are personas?**

- A design tool, to encourage products that will work for a wider range of people
- Typically, several different detailed descriptions of potential users
- Usually not empirically defined, but can be (ours are!)

### Survey 2: Pre-test measures
